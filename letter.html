 Fought many battles together, had many ups and down but yet we're are still together and that's all that matters💕💓. We both may not be perfect yet but someday we will. I love you the most and always will✨. I will forever support your dreams and pray that you achieve everything in life 💓. You mean alot to me. Helped me alot and standes for me when nobody did💕.
      

 Still Remember the day we first talked and the first time you bought me a chocolate🍫 and the day we first meet. Still can't believe we are dating and i still love you the same as day one and won't change my love for you.
